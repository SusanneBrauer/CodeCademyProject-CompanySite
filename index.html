            The live room has an open plan layout which is large enough for full
            band live multitrack sessions with nice sound separation & good
            visual communication. It is also a great drum tracking room offering
            a big room & dry room recording options.

          <h4>Recording</h4>
          <p>Black Tree uses Pro Tools music software exclusively. Pro Tools is industry standard software, virtually every studio uses this system, we’d even go as far to say around 80% of music you hear has probably been recorded on an Avid Pro Tools system.</p>
          <p>We can record up to 32 Tracks simultaneously.</p>

        <div class="col2">
          <h4>Mixing</h4>
          <p>There’s really not a lot to say here. Obviously mixing is a key element of the recording process. It is also something that is very hard to explain, as every session is different.</p>
          <p>BlackTree offers, what we call a post record option. This is a Mix only package, that means; you record & we mix (and obviously master if required). We know that plenty of people these days own they’re own DAW software, enabling you to record a large majority of your material at home. But often where the process tends to fall a bit flat, is in the mix. Studios spend a large amount of money on their equipment, probably far more than most people can afford. This option is adapted by a lot of musicians these days.</p>

          <h4>Mastering</h4>
          <p>Historically a mastering engineer was a person who ensured that a musical programme was successfully committed to a musical release medium such as vinyl or cd. This much is true today and yet the mastering engineers role has changed to some degree to involve a cross over into other areas of audio production. Mastering engineers have had to adapt to the changes in the music industry and the world at large.</p>
